The steps below were tested on **OS X Mountain Lion**.

- [System update](#system-update)
- [System preferences](#system-preferences)
- [Homebrew](#homebrew)
- [Firefox](#firefox)
- [iTerm2](#iterm2)
- [Beautiful terminal](#beautiful-terminal)
- [iTerm2](#iterm2)
- [Git](#git)
- [Vim](#vim)
- [Python](#python)
- [Virtualenv](#virtualenv)
- [IPython](#ipython)
- [Numpy and Scipy](#numpy-and-scipy)
- [Node.js](#nodejs)
- [JSHint](#jshint)
- [Ruby and RVM](#ruby-and-rvm)
- [LESS](#less)
- [Projects folder](#projects-folder)
- [Apps](#apps)

## System update

Immediately upon finishing a new system installation update the system:
**Apple Icon > Software Update...**

## System preferences

It is possible to script System Preferences changes (including options
not available in the GUI) via the `defaults` command, however defaults can
be structured in complex ways and change significantly with operating
system versions so automating these changes can involve excessive
amounts of maintenance.

Make the following manual changes to the System Preferences.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- General > Appearance > Graphite
- General > Highlight color > Other
- General > Show scroll bars > Always
- Language & Region > Time format > 24-Hour Time
- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Energy Saver > Turn display off after: 1 hr
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Modifier Keys > Caps Lock = Control
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock
- Dock > Size > Small (all the way to the left)
- Spotlight > Search Results > Uncheck Spotlight Suggestions and Bing Web
  Searches
- Security & Privacy > Location Services > Disable Location Services
- Security & Privacy > Diagnostics & Usage > Uncheck everything
- Security & Privacy > General > Require password immediately after sleep or
  screen saver begins
- Security & Privacy > Firewall > Turn On Firewall
- Sharing > Turn off all sharing
- Sharing >  Computer Name > Change this to taste
- Network > Advanced > DNS > DNS Servers > 84.200.69.80
  (dns.watch)
- Network > Advanced > DNS > DNS Servers > 84.200.70.40
  (dns.watch)

## Homebrew

Package managers make it so much easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

### Install

An important dependency before Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Tools** for **Xcode**. These include compilers that will allow you to build things from source.

**Note**: If you are running **OS X 10.9 Mavericks**, then you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools directly from the command line with `$ xcode-select --install`, and you don't have to go through the download page and the questionnaire.

Finally, we can install Hombrew! In the terminal paste the following line (without the `$`), hit **Enter**, and follow the steps on the screen:

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

One thing we need to do is tell the system to use programs installed by Hombrew (in `/usr/local/bin`) rather than the OS default if it exists. We do this by adding `/usr/local/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable:

    $ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

Open a new terminal tab with **Cmd+T** (you should also close the old one), then run the following command to make sure everything works:

    $ brew doctor
    
### Usage

To install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

    $ brew install <formula>
        
To update Homebrew's directory of formulae, run:

    $ brew update
    
**Note**: I've seen that command fail sometimes because of a bug. If that ever happens, run the following (when you have Git installed):

    $ cd /usr/local
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git reset --hard origin/master

To see if any of your packages need to be updated:

    $ brew outdated
    
To update a package:

    $ brew upgrade <formula>
        
Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

    $ brew cleanup

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

    $ brew list --versions

## Firefox

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/) is installed via
Homebrew, but it still needs [Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
and some configuration.

### Add-ons

Install the following:
- [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/)
- [Privacy Settings](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-settings/)
In **Privacy Settings** select the **Full Privacy** settings group.

### Search Engines

Go to each of the following websites and select **Add to Firefox**:
- [Startpage](https://startpage.com)
- [ixquick](https://ixquick.com)

## iTerm2

[iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) is installed via Homebrew but needs
configuring.

In **iTerm > Preferences...**, under the tab **General**, uncheck **Confirm closing multiple sessions** and **Confirm "Quit iTerm2 (Cmd+Q)" command** under the section **Closing**.

In the tab **Profiles**, create a new one with the "+" icon, and rename it to your first name for example. Then, select **Other Actions... > Set as Default**. Finally, under the section **Window**, change the size to something better, like **Columns: 125** and **Rows: 35**.

## Beautiful terminal

Since we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place. What follows might seem like a lot of work, but trust me, it'll make the development experience so much better.

Let's go ahead and start by changing the font. In **iTerm > Preferences...**, under the tab **Profiles**, section **Text**, change both fonts to **Consolas 13pt**.

Now let's add some color. I'm a big fan of the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme. It is supposed to be scientifically optimal for the eyes. I just find it pretty.

Scroll down the page and download the latest version. Unzip the archive. In it you will find the `iterm2-colors-solarized` folder with a `README.md` file, but I will just walk you through it here:

- In **iTerm2 Preferences**, under **Profiles** and **Colors**, go to **Load Presets... > Import...**, find and open the two **.itermcolors** files we downloaded.
- Go back to **Load Presets...** and select **Solarized Dark** to activate it. Voila!


Not a lot of colors yet. We need to tweak a little bit our Unix user's profile for that. This is done (on OS X and Linux), in the `~/.bash_profile` text file (`~` stands for the user's home directory).

We'll come back to the details of that later, but for now, just download the files [.bash_profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_profile), [.bash_prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_prompt), [.aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.aliases) attached to this document into your home directory (`.bash_profile` is the one that gets loaded, I've set it up to call the others):

    $ cd ~
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_profile
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_prompt
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.aliases
    
With that, open a new terminal tab (Cmd+T) and see the change! Try the list commands: `ls`, `ls -lh` (aliased to `ll`), `ls -lha` (aliased to `la`).

At this point you can also change your computer's name, which shows up in this terminal prompt. If you want to do so, go to **System Preferences** > **Sharing**. For example, I changed mine from "Nicolas's MacBook Air" to just "MacBook Air", so it shows up as `MacBook-Air` in the terminal.

Now we have a terminal we can work with!

(Thanks to Mathias Bynens for his awesome [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).)

## Git

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is installed via Homebrew and
`$HOME/.gitconfig` is linked to `$HOME/.dotfiles/gitconfig` by the
bootstrap script, but `$HOME/.gitconfig_local` must be placed manually
as it may contain sensitive material.
    
## Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

## Python

OS X, like Linux, ships with [Python](http://python.org/) already installed. But you don't want to mess with the system Python (some system tools rely on it, etc.), so we'll install our own version with Homebrew. It will also allow us to get the very latest version of Python 2.7.

The following command will install Python 2.7 and any dependencies required (it can take a few minutes to build everything):

    $ brew install python
    
When finished, you should get a summary in the terminal. Running `$ which python` should output `/usr/local/bin/python`.

It also installed [Pip]() (and its dependency [Distribute]()), which is the package manager for Python. Let's upgrade them both:

    $ pip install --upgrade distribute
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    
Executable scripts from Python packages you install will be put in `/usr/local/share/python`, so let's add it to the `$PATH`. To do so, we'll create a `.path` text file in the home directory (I've already set up `.bash_profile` to call this file):

    $ cd ~
    $ subl .path
    
And add these lines to `.path`:

```bash
PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH
export PATH
```
    
Save the file and open a new terminal to take the new `$PATH` into account (everytime you open a terminal, `.bash_profile` gets loaded).

### Pip Usage

Here are a couple Pip commands to get you started. To install a Python package:

    $ pip install <package>

To upgrade a package:

    $ pip install --upgrade <package>
        
To see what's installed:

    $ pip freeze
    
To uninstall a package:

    $ pip uninstall <package>

## Virtualenv

[Virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) is a tool that creates an isolated Python environment for each of your projects. For a particular project, instead of installing required packages globally, it is best to install them in an isolated folder in the project (say a folder named `venv`), that will be managed by virtualenv.

The advantage is that different projects might require different versions of packages, and it would be hard to manage that if you install packages globally. It also allows you to keep your global `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` folder clean, containing only critical or big packages that you always need (like IPython, Numpy).

### Install

To install virtualenv, simply run:

    $ pip install virtualenv

### Usage

Let's say you have a project in a directory called `myproject`. To set up virtualenv for that project:

    $ cd myproject/
    $ virtualenv venv --distribute
    
If you want your virtualenv to also inherit globally installed packages (like IPython or Numpy mentioned above), use:

    $ virtualenv venv --distribute --system-site-packages

These commands create a `venv` subdirectory in your project where everything is installed. You need to **activate** it first though (in every terminal where you are working on your project):

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    
You should see a `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt indicating that you are working inside the virtualenv. Now when you install something:

    $ pip install <package>

It will get installed in the `venv` folder, and not conflict with other projects.

**Important**: Remember to add `venv` to your project's `.gitignore` file so you don't include all of that in your source code!

As mentioned earlier, I like to install big packages (like Numpy), or packages I always use (like IPython) globally. All the rest I install in a virtualenv.

## IPython

[IPython](http://ipython.org/) is an awesome project which provides a much better Python shell than the one you get from running `$ python` in the command-line. It has many cool functions (running Unix commands from the Python shell, easy copy & paste, creating Matplotlib charts in-line, etc.) and I'll let you refer to the [documentation](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/index.html) to discover them.

### Install

Before we install IPython, we'll need to get some dependencies. Run the following:

    $ brew update # Always good to do
    $ brew install zeromq # Necessary for pyzmq
    $ brew install pyqt # Necessary for the qtconsole
    
It may take a few minutes to build these.

Once it's done, we can install IPython with all the available options:

    $ pip install ipython[zmq,qtconsole,notebook,test]

### Usage

You can launch IPython from the command line with `$ ipython`, but what's more interesting is to use its [QT Console](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/qtconsole.html). Launch the QT Console by running:

    $ ipython qtconsole
    
You can also customize the font it uses:

    $ ipython qtconsole --ConsoleWidget.font_family="Consolas" --ConsoleWidget.font_size=13
    
And since I'm lazy and I don't want to type or copy & paste that all the time, I'm going to create an alias for it. Create a `.extra` text file in your home directory with `$ subl ~/.extra` (I've set up `.bash_profile` to load `.extra`), and add the following line:

```bash
alias ipy='ipython qtconsole --ConsoleWidget.font_family="Consolas" --ConsoleWidget.font_size=13'
```
    
Open a fresh terminal. Now when you run `$ ipy`, it will launch the QT Console with your configured options.

To use the in-line Matplotlib functionality (nice for scientific computing), run `$ ipy --pylab=inline`.

## Numpy and Scipy

The [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) and [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/SciPy) scientific libraries for Python are always a little tricky to install from source because they have all these dependencies they need to build correctly. Luckily for us, [Samuel John](http://www.samueljohn.de/) has put together some [Homebrew formulae](https://github.com/samueljohn/homebrew-python) to make it easier to install these Python libraries.

First, grab the special formulae (which are not part of Homebrew core):

    $ brew tap samueljohn/python
    $ brew tap homebrew/science
    
Then, install the `gfortran` dependency (now in `gcc`) which we will need to build the libraries:

    $ brew install gcc
    
Finally, you can install Numpy and Scipy with:

    $ brew install numpy
    $ brew install scipy
    
(It may take a few minutes to build.)

## Node.js

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) with Homebrew:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install node
    
The formula also installs the [npm](https://npmjs.org/) package manager. However, as suggested by the Homebrew output, we need to add `/usr/local/share/npm/bin` to our path so that npm-installed modules with executables will have them picked up.

To do so, add this line to your `~/.path` file, before the `export PATH` line:

```bash
PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH
```
        
Open a new terminal for the `$PATH` changes to take effect.

We also need to tell npm where to find the Xcode Command Line Tools, by running:

    $ sudo xcode-select -switch /usr/bin

(If Xcode Command Line Tools were installed by Xcode, try instead:)

    $ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

Node modules are installed locally in the `node_modules` folder of each project by default, but there are at least two that are worth installing globally. Those are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    $ npm install -g coffee-script
    $ npm install -g grunt-cli

### Npm usage

To install a package:

    $ npm install <package> # Install locally
    $ npm install -g <package> # Install globally

To install a package and save it in your project's `package.json` file:

    $ npm install <package> --save

To see what's installed:

    $ npm list # Local
    $ npm list -g # Global

To find outdated packages (locally or globally):

    $ npm outdated [-g]

To upgrade all or a particular package:

    $ npm update [<package>]

To uninstall a package:

    $ npm uninstall <package>

##JSHint

JSHint is a JavaScript developer's best friend. 

If the extra credit assignment to install Sublime Package Manager was completed, JSHint can be run as part of Sublime Text. 

Install JSHint via npm (global install preferred)

    $ npm install -g jshint

Follow additional instructions on the [JSHint Package Manager page](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/JSHint) or [build it manually](https://github.com/jshint/jshint).

## Ruby and RVM

Like Python, [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is already installed on Unix systems. But we don't want to mess around with that installation. More importantly, we want to be able to use the latest version of Ruby.

### Install

When installing Ruby, best practice is to use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) (Ruby Version Manager) which allows you to manage multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine. Installing RVM, as well as the latest version of Ruby, is very easy. Just run:

    $ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    
When it is done, both RVM and a fresh version of Ruby 2.0 are installed. The following line was also automatically added to your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
```

I prefer to move that line to the `.extra` file, keeping my `.bash_profile` clean. I suggest you do the same.

After that, start a new terminal and run:

    $ type rvm | head -1
    
You should get the output `rvm is a function`.

### Usage

The following command will show you which versions of Ruby you have installed:

    $ rvm list

The one that was just installed, Ruby 2.0, should be set as default. When managing multiple versions, you switch between them with:

    $ rvm use system # Switch back to system install (1.8)
    $ rvm use 2.0.0 --default # Switch to 2.0.0 and sets it as default

Run the following to make sure the version you want is being used (in our case, the just-installed Ruby 1.9.3):

    $ which ruby
    $ ruby --version

You can install another version with:

    $ rvm install 1.9.3

To update RVM itself, use:

    $ rvm get stable
    
[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/), the Ruby package manager, was also installed:

    $ which gem
    
Update to its latest version with:

    $ gem update --system
    
To install a "gem" (Ruby package), run:

    $ gem install <gemname>
        
To install without generating the documentation for each gem (faster):

    $ gem install <gemname> --no-document
        
To see what gems you have installed:

    $ gem list
    
To check if any installed gems are outdated:

    $ gem outdated
    
To update all gems or a particular gem:

    $ gem update [<gemname>]
    
RubyGems keeps old versions of gems, so feel free to do come cleaning after updating:

    $ gem cleanup
    
I mainly use Ruby for the CSS pre-processor [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), which is built on top of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/):

    $ gem install compass --no-document

## LESS

CSS preprocessors are becoming quite popular, the most popular processors are [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com). Preprocessing is a lot like compiling code for CSS. It allows you to reuse CSS in many different ways. Let's start out with using LESS as a basic preprocessor, it's used by a lot of popular CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

### Install

To install LESS you have to use NPM / Node, which you installed earlier using Homebrew. In the terminal use:

    $ npm install less --global

Note: the `--global` flag is optional but it prevents having to mess around with file paths. You can install without the flag, just know what you're doing.

You can check that it installed properly by using:

    $ lessc --version

This should output some information about the compiler:

    lessc 1.5.1 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]

Okay, LESS is installed and running. Great! 

### Usage

There's a lot of different ways to use LESS. Generally I use it to compile my stylesheet locally. You can do that by using this command in the terminal:

    $ lessc template.less template.css

The two options are the "input" and "output" files for the compiler. The command looks in the current directory for the LESS stylesheet, compiles it, and outputs it to the second file in the same directory. You can add in paths to keep your project files organized:

    $ lessc less/template.less css/template.css

Read more about LESS on their page here: http://lesscss.org/


## Projects folder

This really depends on how you want to organize your files, but I like to put all my version-controlled projects in `~/Projects`. Other documents I may have, or things not yet under version control, I like to put in `~/Dropbox` (if you have Dropbox installed), or `~/Documents`.

## Apps

Here is a quick list of some apps I use, and that you might find useful as well:

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): File syncing to the cloud. I put all my documents in Dropbox. It syncs them to all my devices (laptop, mobile, tablet), and serves as a backup as well! **(Free for 2GB)**
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/): File syncing to the cloud too! I use Google Docs a lot to collaborate with others (edit a document with multiple people in real-time!), and sometimes upload other non-Google documents (pictures, etc.), so the app comes in handy for that. **(Free for 5GB)**
- [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword): Allows you to securely store your login and passwords. Even if you only use a few different passwords (they say you shouldn't!), this is really handy to keep track of all the accounts you sign up for! Also, they have a mobile app so you always have all your passwords with you (syncs with Dropbox). A little pricey though. There are free alternatives. **($50 for Mac app, $18 for iOS app)**
- [Marked](http://markedapp.com/): As a developer, most of the stuff you write ends up being in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). In fact, this `README.md` file (possibly the most important file of a GitHub repo) is indeed in Markdown, written in Sublime Text, and I use Marked to preview the results everytime I save. **($4)**
- [Path Finder](http://cocoatech.com/pathfinder/): I love OSX, it's Unix so great for developers, and all of it just works and looks pretty! Only thing I "miss" from Windows (OMG what did he say?), is a decent file explorer. I think Finder is a pain to use. So I gladly paid for this alternative, but I understand others might find it expensive just to not have to use Finder. **($40)**
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/): If I don't write something down, I'll forget it. As a developer, you learn so many new things every day, and technology keeps changing, it would be insane to want to keep it all in your head. So take notes, sync them to the cloud, and have them on all your devices. To be honest, I switched to [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/) because I only take text notes, and I got tired of Evernote putting extra spaces between paragraphs when I copy & pasted into other applications. Simplenote is so much better for text notes (and it supports Markdown!). **(Both are free)**
- [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/): Don't waste time resizing and moving your windows. Moom makes this very easy. **($10)**
