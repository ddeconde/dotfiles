# Install command-line tools using Homebrew
# Usage: `brew bundle Brewfile`
#


# First be sure to execute the next line in the terminal to install Homebrew:
# ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Just in case this is not a new clean install:
update # make certain that Homebrew is up to date
upgrade # upgrade any already installed formulae

# In case particular versions (rather than most up-to-date) are required
# uncomment the following line and then just 'brew install <formula>' or
# in the case of a conflict 'brew install homebrew/versions/<formula>':
# brew tap homebrew/versions

# In case a more recent/bug-fixed version of an included OS X utility is
# require uncomment the following line and then 'brew install <formula>'
# or in the case of a conflict 'brew install homebrew/dupes/<formula>':
# brew tap homebrew/dupes
