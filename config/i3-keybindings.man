       i3-keybindings - keybindings for controlling the i3 window manager

       According  to  default configuration, in ii33 focus follows the mouse and
       the mouse can be used to resize windows by  dragging  on  the  borders.
       The  mouse is also useful for interacting with GUI applications running
       within windows.  However  most  interaction  with  the  window  manager
       itself  is  through  the  keyboard  with  windows  being opened, moved,
       selected, resized, and closed via keybindings listed below.  See  ii33(1)
       for  information  about default keybindings and how to configure custom
       ones.

       The keyword MMoodd refers to the _W_i_n_d_o_w_s (Mod4) key, a convenient alterna-
       tive  to  the default modifier key _A_l_t (Mod1) which might conflict with
       some application-defined shortcuts.  Bindings marked with '*' are  cus-
       tom, the rest are i3 defaults.

       Mod+Enter
              Open a new terminal emulator window.

       Mod+d
              Open  dmenu for starting any application by typing (part of) its
              name.

       Mod+Shift+q
              Kills the current window.  This is equivalent  to  "clicking  on
              the  close  button", meaning a polite request to the application
              to close this window.  For example, Firefox will save  its  ses-
              sion  upon  such a request.  If the application does not support
              that, the window will be killed and it depends on  the  applica-
              tion what happens.

       Mod+Shfit+e
              Exits i3.

       Mod+Shift+r

              When starting, i3 loads keybindings (among  other  things)  from
              its  configuration  file.  See ii33(1) for further details of this
              file's location and how keybindings are specified within it.

NNOOTTEESS
       As a window manager, i3 is not designed to control more than the place-
       ment  and  appearance  of windows.  Though there are keybindings listed
       above that pertain to other  functions,  these  are  just  triggers  to
       launch suitable applications.  The primary way to run software in i3 is
       not via keybindings, but opening a terminal and entering commands.  For
       launching  GUI  applications  using the rofi or dmenu keybinding listed
       above and typing (part of) the program name may be most convenient.
